Technical
=========

1.) condition / cancer type = anatomic sites lookup (based upon distinct anatomic site names in pg)
2.) location geo-encoding
3.) front-end react filter logic
4.) targets (based on biomarkers?)
5.) unstructured eligibility criteria display on detailed page
6.) break out react components
7.) actually use redux flow and manage reducer and store state
8.) add treatment type and name (ex: name of drug) based on arm data
9.) deploy to a live dev server (and password protect access)
10.) write tests
11.) small cell lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer)

Design
======

1.) what are the use-cases for searching clinical trials? major vs edge?
2.) what order should we put filters?
3.) what data needs to be reformulated to be more helpful (ex: lay titles, description)?
4.) what other information would be helpful on the search results and detailed description page?
